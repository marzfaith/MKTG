### Filter rows with filter()
Allows to subset observations based on their values
First argument: name of data frame
Second argument +: expressions that filter the data frame
```{r}
filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```
The arrow saves the results
```{r}
jan1 <- filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```
The arrow and parentheses saves AND prints the results
```{r}
(dec25 <- filter(flights, month == 12, day == 25))
```
